# Snake Game
This is a simple Snake game made using the Turtle module in Python.

The game will automatically save your highest score to a file called data.txt in the same directory as snake.py. 
If you beat your highest score, it will be updated automatically.

Installation
    1) Clone the repository using git clone.
    2) Install the required modules using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Usage
    Run main.py to start the game. Use the arrow keys to move the snake.

Features
    1) The snake grows in size as it eats food.
    2) The game ends if the snake collides with a wall or its own body.
    3) The score is displayed on the screen.
    4) The game can be reset by pressing the space bar.

Future Improvements
    1) Add sound effects and music.
    2) Improve the graphics.
    3) Delete the existing snake turtles for new game.
